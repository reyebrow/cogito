been modified beyond recognition and about 90% of the boron code has been 
replaced.

Most people will want the header of their site to be customizable so the region 
header file has been included for your convenience. Anything that goes in this

You might want to put special logic in this file so it behaves differently on 
every page or you might want to customize it with a particular logo and site
title. All of this is possible using this file.
