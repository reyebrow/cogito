Boron is a base theme which converts the core template files to HTML5 markup.
Like other minimal base themes, such as Zen and Stark, it includes only a few
lines of layout-driven CSS, and markup that is search engine optimized.

Unlike the others, Boron utilizes the new HTML5 doctype and semantic elements,
such as Article, Header, Footer, and Section. The result is a
standards-compliant theme with valid markup and minimal CSS that can be used
as a jumping off point for developing new sub-themes. This leaves your site
positioned to take advantage of new HTML5 features as they come into vogue.

PHILOSOPHY
The goal of developing this theme was to convert the core Drupal
templates to HTML5. Wherever possible, core markup, attributes and class names
were left intact, and elements were simply converted to their HTML5
equivalents. This should make development easier, since this theme follows the
standards and philosophies established by the core templates.

FEATURES

 - Header and Footer sections marked up with header and footer elements
 - Navigation marked up with nav elements
